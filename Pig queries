PIG QUERIES:
1.Load the data into a relation
>>DEFINE ApacheCommonLogLoader org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.apachelog. CommonLogLoader (); 
>>DEFINE DayExtractor org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.util.apachelogparser. DateExtractor ('yyyy-MM-dd');

2.Loadig Data to a variable:
Query :shop6 = LOAD '/home/hdoop/Downloads' USING PigStorage(',') as (clickstream_id:Double,Dates:chararray,time:chararray,timestamp:chararray ,IP_address:chararray,url:chararray,is_purchased:int,is_page_errored:float,user_session_id:chararray,city:chararray,state:chararray,country:chararray);
Output: this query creates the table in the pig environment


3.Describing the dataset loaded:(Structure of the dataset)
describe eshop8;
Output:
shop8: {clickstream_id: double,Dates: chararray,time: chararray,timestamp: chararray,IP_address: chararray,url: chararray,is_purchased: int,is_page_errored: float,user_session_id: chararray,city: chararray,state: chararray,country: chararray}


4.Query :  grpd = GROUP eshop8 BY IP_address; 
req_cnt = FOREACH grpd GENERATE group AS IP_address, COUNT(eshop8) AS tot_visits;
Output:
This query is used to retrieve how many times a particular customer has visited our webpage.
 
 
5.Query :  User_foreach = foreach shop8 generate IP_address,city;
Limit_data = LIMIT user_foreach 5;
DUMP Limit_data;
Output:
This query is used to create a separate schema or a table for the declared instances
 

6.Query : filter_data = FILTER shop8 BY city == ‘detroit’
DUMP filter_data
Output:
This query is used to retrieve all the rows which has ‘detroit’ as its city
 

7.Query: ip_data = GROUP shop8 BY IP_address;
Ip_count-FOREACH ip_data GENERATE group AS timestamp , COUNT(shop8) as total_visits;
DUMP ip_count;
Output:
This query gets the Total number of request from a specific address
     

8.Query: fil= FILTER shop8 BY is_purchased == 0;
unsuccess = LIMIT fil 25;
DUMP unsuccess
Output:
This query is used to get the Total number of unsuccessful requests or purchases
 

9.Query : fil= FILTER shop8 BY is_purchased == 1;
success = LIMIT fil 25;
DUMP success
Output:
This query is used to get the details of the customers whose purchase has been successful.
 

10.Query: time_data = GROUP shop8 BY DayExtractor(timestamp) as day; 
byte_count = FOREACH time_data GENERATE group AS timestamp,SUM(shop8.times) AS total_bytes;
Output:
This query is used to print the total interaction minutes of the customers
