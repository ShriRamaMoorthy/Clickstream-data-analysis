# Clickstream-data-analysis

## Aim: ##
To write queries on both Hive and Pig based on Clickstream Data Analysis in order to infer the results and improve the advertising of a Corporation Firm

## Scope of the project: ##
* A clickstream is a sequence or stream of events that represent user actions (clicks) on a website, ios, or android application. But the scope of clickstream analysis extends beyond clicks. It includes product searches, impressions, purchases, and any other relevant user interactions that can help the business better understand the customer. 
* The usage statistics of the web page are captured in clickstream data. This data type provides insight into what a user is doing on the web page, and can provide data that is highly useful for behaviour and usability analysis, marketing, and general research. 
* The main objective is to infer and gather useful insights which are invaluable for digital marketing and product teams.
